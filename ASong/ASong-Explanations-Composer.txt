Section 1: As section 1 is the intro of the song it was important to set the mood immediately. I decided to play in mezzo piano as I wanted to set a soft mood that conveyed the innocence of young love.
Section 2: In section 2 I decided to create some conflict with a sadder melody. I also used a crescendo to rise from section 1 to section 2 to emphasise the intensity of this conflict.
Section 3: The third section repeats the melody and harmony of section 2 as it is a continuation of the conflict.  However, both the harmony and melody are played an octave higher at mezzo piano. This creates a lighter conflict and represents the end of conflict. The section ends with a crescendo to rise to the finale of the song.
Section 4: Section 4 is the final section and repeats the melody and harmony of section 1. It continues playing in a higher octave to maintain some aspect of the previous section. This is to show that even though the conflict has been resolved, the love has not returned to what it was before. The song ends with ritardando to create a calm and soft end to the music.
