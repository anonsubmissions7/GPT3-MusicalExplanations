Section 1: A add9 sets up a comfortable feeling, leading into the D add 9. Creates a really mellow, peaceful vibe through tonal ambiguity. Moving the D chord lower creates a lush harmonic comparison to the bright A chord.
Section 2: Using the E major chord to lead back into the A, felt like the piece needed some level of tonal direction. This moment felt right as the section changed to a more melodic one. Use of different voicing structures gave certain parts of the melody more strength. Did this as I felt it would be more compelling narratively. Moved to the F#min chord as it voicelead nicely from the previous chord and had a mysterious and dark sound to it.
Section 3: Evolution of the melody, using the same notes as the first section of the piece. Rhythmic differentiation felt like a nice way to push the scope of the melody. Use of a line leading back to the melody fragment to avoid a repetitive large jump in pitch, as well as being somewhat of a reprisal of the original melody. Moving between Sus4 and Major chords on the tonic here, felt as if it added energy to the composition. And set up nicely for an ending without providing too much in the way of harmonic variation. 
Section 4: Nice little descending pentatonic line, added the crotchet triplet pattern across the chord tones of the A chord as I felt it had a bit of oomph to it and would nicely wrap up the piece whilst bringing back the key harmonic elements. Accidentally played a B instead of A at the end, but played it off smoothly with an A added afterwards.The rhythmic intrigue of the triplet pattern also felt cool in comparison to the largely simple rhythmic structures throughout the song, spicing it up a little.
